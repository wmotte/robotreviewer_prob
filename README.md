# RobotReviewer probabilistic

[Robotreviewer](https://github.com/ijmarshall/robotreviewer3) allows automatic extraction of data from clinical trial reports.
It extracts *PICO* characteristics (Population, Interventions/Comparators, and Outcomes), and assesses trials for likely biases using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.

This repository provides adjustments in the code to retrieve probabilistic estimates.
It also offers scripts to automatically classify large numbers of pdfs or xml-converted files.
